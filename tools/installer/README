#
# About
#
This installer automatically downloads specified YPG Scheduler release and
installs it to configured folders. During the process it updates itself to
version distributed with specified release package, so you don't have to worry
about keeping it up to date yourself.

Basic usage example:
get-release 0.9.0-presentation
To get list of releases:
get-release -l

#
# Configuration
#
Copy file "configuration.template" to "configuration" and edit it to your
liking. Remember to chmod it to 0600 before storing svn password in there (you
don't have to store any credentials there, if you don't mind being asked for
them with every installer run).

#
# Initialization files
#
Directories given in TARGET_PUBLIC and TARGET_PRIVATE will be deleted during
installation process, so all custom changes since previous installation will be
lost. You can use "initialization" directory to include new files or modify
those existing in release package in a way that will be preserved between
installations. All files in this directory will be copied to installation
directories during install. Place directly in "initialization" files you want
to be included in TARGET_PRIVATE and in "initialization/public" those that
should be copied into TARGET_PUBLIC.

You probably want to include there configuration files:
global-headers/configuration.inc.php
rpc-headers/configuration.inc.php
ui-headers/configuration.inc.php
public/includes/require-globals.php
public/amfphp/require-globals.php

But any other file will do. I.e. if you want custom favicon place it under:
public/favicon.ico
